Comparative analysis of various machine learning approaches on stroke dataset for stroke prediction.

Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to a portion of our brain is cut off, preventing brain tissue from receiving oxygen. Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and die within minutes. The person enters a state of inactivity that necessitates rest and, in the worst-case scenario, coma or death. Stroke occurs in older people, but studies show that the risk increases with age and that it can occur at any age. People who lead a certain lifestyle, such as smoking or drinking, increase their chances of having a stroke. As a result, there is a need for early detection of stroke so that we can diagnose patients with stroke and save their lives. In our Research, we explored various machine learning approaches such as XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, Catboost , Multilayer Perceptron , KNeighbours, and others to Train,Tune, and Test these approaches on high feature attributes from the Dataset, and we Discover that XGBoost is the Best Model for Predicting Stroke, with an Accuracy Score of 94.6183 %.
